All my code is in PhysicsLab/ 
There's a build you can run in build/

To create a build use the VS2012 sln in this directory. All dependencies are included.

The assignments 1-5 cumulative report and assignment slides 
are in this directory.

I used a modified version of Irlan Robson's Bounce library (https://github.com/irlanrobson/Bounce-Lite) 
for the constraint solver demo. The b3ExtraSettings class exposes variables used to demonstrate 
the constraint solver pipeline.
